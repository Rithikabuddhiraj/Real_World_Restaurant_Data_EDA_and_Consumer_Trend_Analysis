# Restaurant Data EDA with Pandas, Seaborn and Consumer Trend Analysis

This project focuses on performing comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world restaurant dataset to extract actionable insights, understand consumer behavior, and visualize patterns using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 🔍 Objective

- Analyze and clean restaurant data to ensure consistency and reliability.
- Uncover patterns and relationships between restaurant attributes (location, cuisine, rating, price, etc.).
- Understand customer preferences and market trends through visual analytics.
- Derive insights to assist in data-driven decision-making for restaurant businesses.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for iterative data exploration

## 📊 Key Highlights

- Handled missing values and standardized categorical data.
- Analyzed distributions of restaurant ratings, average costs, cuisines, and more.
- Explored geographic distribution of restaurants by cities and countries.
- Visualized correlations and trend patterns through heatmaps, count plots, and bar graphs.
- Provided business-friendly interpretations and takeaways for each visual.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains real-world restaurant data with features like:
- Restaurant name
- Location and city
- Cuisine type
- Aggregate ratings
- Price range
- Online delivery availability

> The dataset was preprocessed for quality and consistency before analysis.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
